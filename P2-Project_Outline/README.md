## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Website that lets delivery drivers leave notes on troublesome locations/customers. When a delivery pops up,  delivery drivers will be able to type in the address, and all notes on the location and customers will appear.  After a delivery, drivers will be able to assign notes to a location. For example, if a house’s address is hard to see, they can write down descriptors that will make the house easy to recognize. They will also be able to leave notes on customers. If one customer tends to like extra butter with their baguettes but doesn’t leave a comment to say so, the driver won’t need to remember, and can just check the website.

As one delivery business may have completely different addresses and needs than another, each business will have a “team” that drivers will be assigned to. So business 1’s driver will only see notes from other business 1 drivers, and business 2 drivers will only see business 1 driver notes. The team manager will be able to handle administrative functions like adding drivers to the team or removing them.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I’m going to need to learn some front end stuff. I’m going to research a lot more but I think Bootstrap will do. I really would love to use this project to learn some JavaScript too. I’d like to make nice quality of life features like an address search with auto complete. This website needs to be quick to use since it’s purpose is saving delivery drivers time and hopefully earning  them better tips. I also need to learn more about login to make the teams work, but I have some ideas on how I’m going to get that done.
